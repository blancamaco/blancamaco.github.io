                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>As a Product Designer, I led the end-to-end design process for Voicemod Clips, a mobile application available on iOS and Android platforms. This innovative app harnessed Voicemod's cutting-edge voice-changing technology, allowing users to apply dynamic voice effects to their recorded audios, videos, and even GIFS. The primary objective was to empower users to create unique and entertaining content for social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat.</p>

                            <h4>Challenges</h4>
                            <p>
                                One of the key problems of the Voicemod ecosystem was the lack fo a specifically designed for the mobile space. Additionally, there was no way in Voicemod ecosystem to record themselves, using Voicemod in an asynchronous way. Users only can hear themselves and be heard by other people, but they couldn't record content for other use cases like dubbing a video, creating voiceovers, creating audio assets, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Looking at the user feedback in our Discord Community, we saw that they were requesting for a long time an asynchronous use case for Voicemod, allowing them to apply voice-changing effects to pre-recorded audios and videos, not only using them in live conversations.
                            </p>

                                    <p>During our research, it was obvious a growing trend of apps centered around fast video content, like TikTok, Snapchat or Instagram Reels, catering to the preferences of Gen Z users as apps to consume and produce short video content.</p>
                                    <p>During our research, we sent out a survey to a group of users belonging to Gen Z, who were identified as power users of Voicemod. The aim was to understand their communication habits and preferences.</p>
                                    <p>The survey results revealed that Gen Z users primarily communicate through platforms such as FaceTime, Snapchat, and iMessage. These users frequently engage in communication methods like making calls and sending audio messages. This valuable insight further emphasized the potential for Voicemod Clips to cater to their preferences and provide a unique and entertaining experience in these communication spaces and offer a unique and entertaining experience.</p>

                                    <p>In the initial phases, I worked closely with the Voicemod team to conceptualize the app's features and functionalities.

                                    <p>Recognizing the user needs they had been requesting and seeing these opportunities on the mobile space, we embarked on the journey of developing Voicemod Clips, providing a dedicated mobile application that fulfilled these demands and empowered users to unleash their creativity and have fun on another level.</p>

                                    <p>To address the user needs and the asynchronous use case demands, Voicemod Clips incorporated the following key features:.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Apply Voice Changers to User's Audio:</strong> Users can easily apply a wide range of voice-changing effects to their pre-recorded audios, allowing them to transform their voice in creative ways and send them to their friends or use them to create other audiovisual content.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Apply Voice Changers to Video Audio:</strong> Users to apply voice-changing effects not only to their audio recordings but also to the audio tracks of their videos. This functionality was focused on creating engaging and fun content to share on social media apps.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Users could now effortlessly create and share engaging content on various social media platforms or communicate via voice messages in a different way with their friends, showcasing their creativity and having fun.</p>

                                <p>Throughout the development process, we actively sought user feedback and continuously, including in-app messages asking for feedback in key moments, that helped us to iterate on Voicemod Clips based on their input. As a result, we introduced several additional features to further expand the creative capabilities of our users.</p>

          <h1 class="color-subtitle" id="onboarding">üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Onboarding</h1>
          <p>We were restructuring the content of our product, making it more compact so that it is easier to find the functionalities that interest each user. </p>
            <p>Along with this improvement, we had to redesign the onboarding process in the application, taking into account both first-time users and experienced users, who would have to adapt to this new distribution.</p>
            <h4 class="color-subtitle">Problem</h4>
            <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8">
              <p>The current onboarding only consisted of a few modals that described the main functionalities of the app, things that anyone could read on the webpage and didn't help the user on his tasks.</p>
            <p>Our users come to Geoblink to visualise data that is useful for the analysis they do at their job. Our product has a large amount of different data, ways of visualising it and kinds of analyses, what causes that sometimes the users don't know what's the data they need and where to find it.</p>
            <h4><i>Our objective shouldn't be teaching our users how to use our product, we needed to teach them how to solve their problems with our product.</i></h4>
            <p>One of the challenges of the onboarding is to guide them to the data they need and show them how Geoblink can help them to achieve their goals. They need to be successful in their tasks, so they can see the value Geoblink can offer them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
              <img src="images/geoblink/Onboarding1.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="svg image" style="">
              <img src="images/geoblink/Onboarding2.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="svg image" style="">
            </div>

            </div>


            <h4 class="color-subtitle">What functionalities should we include on the onboarding tour? What steps should it have?</h4>
          <p>Our product is really complex, and we want to avoid to overwhelm them with big amounts of new information. We had to get them to see the value with the minimal effort, not telling them about all the functionalities Geoblink has, but <strong>why</strong> a few of them can be useful. A way to reduce the burden and don't scare the user is to split the onboarding up into small steps. Through the steps we could present a problem or a question and what steps could they take to solve it with Geoblink. Thanks to that, they are not just absorbing information but solving a real problem.</p>
          <h4 class="color-subtitle">Kinds of users</h4>
          <p>We have three main kinds of users: Expansion, Marketing and Store network optimisation.</p>
          <p> They have three different kinds of needs and ways to use our product, so a standard onboarding couldn't be useful for any of them. We concluded we should create three different kinds of onboarding depending on what problem each kind of user is trying to solve, and show them the functionalities they need to solve it. We have to motivate them to take the actions and use functionalities that will help them, <strong>focussing on the why should they use them, not on the how.</strong></p>
          <h4 class="color-subtitle">Empathising with current users</h4>
          <p>We could not forget about our current users, the ones that have been using the product for a long time. We were worried that one they log into the product and see that everything had changed and nothing was where they were used to. They would be confused with the changes in the structure, so they would also have to take an onboarding tour. To analyse how the changes could affect to the current use they do of our product, we created an Affinity Diagram to discover possible friction, pain points and opportunities.</p>

          <img src="images/geoblink/AD.PNG" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em" >


          <p>We created a user journey to better visualise the behaviour and the feelings of these users if one they log into our product and see everything has changed. From it, we could find out some pain points which we should focus to solve through the onboarding to reduce the frustration and help them.</p>
