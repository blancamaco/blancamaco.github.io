                        <p><a href="https://www.geoblink.com">Geoblink</a> is a SaaS-based Location Intelligence solution that helps professionals from the retail, real estate, and FMCG industries make informed decisions about their business strategies. It combines traditional and non-traditional advanced analytics techniques over big and small data, together with a rich map-based UI to display multiple types of statistics in a way that is simple to use and easy to understand.</p>
                        <h4 class="color-subtitle">What do I do?</h4>
                        <p>As part of the Product team, I deal with data representation, data consumption and information architecture challenges every day, applying user-centred design to solve them in order to provide the best experience to our users. I'm also constantly working on improving the user experience of the application in general, participating in research initiatives, designing new features and presenting design decisions to the team.</p>
                        <p>We regularly collect users feedback from the Customer Success team to fix usability problems, iterate over previous designs, discover new user pain points or start research initiatives for possible new functionalities.</p>
                        <p>Our application's visual design is based on a design system that we're always updating and maintaining to give the application a consistent style and communicate efficiently with the development team. <a href="https://design-system.geoblink.com">Take a look to the Geoblink Design System.</a></p>

                          </h4>
                          <p>
                            I was one of the people in charge of redefining the onboarding process of the application. In this initiative we analysed the problems with the current onboarding, empathise with the new and current users researching their pain points during this process, defined what features should be shown on the process, analyzed competitors designs, and explored different onboarding styles among others. <strong>Our objective was not to teach our users how to use the application, we needed to show them how to solve their problems.</strong>

                          <p>
                            I also was in charge of the design of the customizable alerts functionality. Frequently our users asked about the possibility to receive alerts by mail or in the app when certain values or thresholds were reached. Along with the product manager, we gathered all the possible things that could be possible to set an alert on and the different parameters and conditions under which the alerts would be triggered. With this information, I did several iterations over different possible user flows and designs.

                          <p>
                            I designed and defined several dashboards for different clients, taking into account the best way to display the data they needed to visualize and the technical constraints of their implementation.

                            I took part on several functionalities and features of the app, on their different phases: Discovery, user interviews, ideation, design iteration, user tests and documentation for the implementation.

                        <p>We were restructuring the content of our product, making it more compact so that it is easier to find the functionalities that interest each user. </p>
                          <p>Along with this improvement, we had to redesign the onboarding process in the application, taking into account both first-time users and experienced users, who would have to adapt to this new distribution.</p>

                            <p>The current onboarding only consisted of a few modals that described the main functionalities of the app, things that anyone could read on the webpage and didn't help the user on his tasks.</p>
                          <p>Our users come to Geoblink to visualise data that is useful for the analysis they do at their job. Our product has a large amount of different data, ways of visualising it and kinds of analyses, what causes that sometimes the users don't know what's the data they need and where to find it.</p>
                          <h3><i>Our objective shouldn't be teaching our users how to use our product, we needed to teach them how to solve their problems with our product.</i></h3>
                          <p>One of the challenges of the onboarding is to guide them to the data they need and show them how Geoblink can help them to achieve their goals. They need to be successful in their tasks, so they can see the value Geoblink can offer them.</p>
                          </div>

                          <h4 class="color-subtitle">What functionalities should we include on the onboarding tour? What steps should it have?</h4>
                        <p>Our product is really complex, and we want to avoid to overwhelm them with big amounts of new information. We had to get them to see the value with the minimal effort, not telling them about all the functionalities Geoblink has, but <strong>why</strong> a few of them can be useful. A way to reduce the burden and don't scare the user is to split the onboarding up into small steps. Through the steps we could present a problem or a question and what steps could they take to solve it with Geoblink. Thanks to that, they are not just absorbing information but solving a real problem.</p>
                        <h4 class="color-subtitle">Kinds of users</h4>
                        <p>We have three main kinds of users: Expansion, Marketing and Store network optimisation.</p>
                        <p> They have three different kinds of needs and ways to use our product, so a standard onboarding couldn't be useful for any of them. We concluded we should create three different kinds of onboarding depending on what problem each kind of user is trying to solve, and show them the functionalities they need to solve it. We have to motivate them to take the actions and use functionalities that will help them, <strong>focussing on the why should they use them, not on the how.</strong></p>
                        <h4 class="color-subtitle">Empathising with current users</h4>
                        <p>We could not forget about our current users, the ones that have been using the product for a long time. We were worried that one they log into the product and see that everything had changed and nothing was where they were used to. They would be confused with the changes in the structure, so they would also have to take an onboarding tour. To analyse how the changes could affect to the current use they do of our product, we created an Affinity Diagram to discover possible friction, pain points and opportunities.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/geoblink/AD.PNG" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em" >
                        
                        
                        <p>We created a user journey to better visualise the behaviour and the feelings of these users if one they log into our product and see everything has changed. From it, we could find out some pain points which we should focus to solve through the onboarding to reduce the frustration and help them.</p>

                        <h4 class="color-subtitle">Inspiration</h4>
                        <p>We explored different ways other applications made the onboarding process to get some inspiration and see if we could incorporate some of them on our onboarding. As a result of this research, I explored different ways in which we could carry out onboarding.<p>
