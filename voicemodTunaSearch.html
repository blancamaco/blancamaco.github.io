                            <p>The existing search feature on Tuna lacked the necessary refinement options, resulting in users struggling to find specific sounds. They had to write exactly what they wanted. The lack of filters, search by multiple tags, and better sorting options made it difficult for users to discover sounds that matched their preferences. This led to a decrease in sound discovery and overall user satisfaction, receiving user feedback from different channels regarding the difficulties in finding the sounds that fit their needs.</p>

                                    <p>During the research phase, we first asked users in our community to gain valuable insights to understand their search behaviors, frustrations, and expectations regarding the sound search.

                                <li>Users expressed frustration with the lack of filtering options, as they were unable to narrow down their search results effectively.</li>

                                <li>The ability to discover sounds based on specific themes or tags was highly desired by users, as it would enhance their overall experience.</li>
                                <li>For them, it was important to search also users Soundboards.</li>

                            <p>During the ideation and conceptualization phase, we engaged in brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and explore potential search solutions, improvements, and layouts. We encouraged open and collaborative discussions with the entire team (Developers and Product Manager), allowing everyone to contribute their thoughts and suggestions.</p>

                            <p>To ensure that we were making the right design decision with the multi-content search, we reached a point where we had two distinct alternatives for the search layout. In order to gather user opinions and feedback, we conducted an unmoderated user test. This test allowed us to understand how users interacted with the different alternatives and helped us make an informed decision on the final design.</p>

                        <div>


                            <!-- <section>
        <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 col-10" style="margin: auto">
          <h1 class="color-subtitle" id="onboarding">👩‍🚀 Onboarding</h1>
          <p>We were restructuring the content of our product, making it more compact so that it is easier to find the functionalities that interest each user. </p>
            <p>Along with this improvement, we had to redesign the onboarding process in the application, taking into account both first-time users and experienced users, who would have to adapt to this new distribution.</p>
            <h4 class="color-subtitle">Problem</h4>
            <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8">
              <p>The current onboarding only consisted of a few modals that described the main functionalities of the app, things that anyone could read on the webpage and didn't help the user on his tasks.</p>
            <p>Our users come to Geoblink to visualise data that is useful for the analysis they do at their job. Our product has a large amount of different data, ways of visualising it and kinds of analyses, what causes that sometimes the users don't know what's the data they need and where to find it.</p>
            <h4><i>Our objective shouldn't be teaching our users how to use our product, we needed to teach them how to solve their problems with our product.</i></h4>
            <p>One of the challenges of the onboarding is to guide them to the data they need and show them how Geoblink can help them to achieve their goals. They need to be successful in their tasks, so they can see the value Geoblink can offer them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
              <img src="images/geoblink/Onboarding1.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="svg image" style="">
              <img src="images/geoblink/Onboarding2.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="svg image" style="">
            </div>

            </div>


            <h4 class="color-subtitle">What functionalities should we include on the onboarding tour? What steps should it have?</h4>
          <p>Our product is really complex, and we want to avoid to overwhelm them with big amounts of new information. We had to get them to see the value with the minimal effort, not telling them about all the functionalities Geoblink has, but <strong>why</strong> a few of them can be useful. A way to reduce the burden and don't scare the user is to split the onboarding up into small steps. Through the steps we could present a problem or a question and what steps could they take to solve it with Geoblink. Thanks to that, they are not just absorbing information but solving a real problem.</p>
          <h4 class="color-subtitle">Kinds of users</h4>
          <p>We have three main kinds of users: Expansion, Marketing and Store network optimisation.</p>
          <p> They have three different kinds of needs and ways to use our product, so a standard onboarding couldn't be useful for any of them. We concluded we should create three different kinds of onboarding depending on what problem each kind of user is trying to solve, and show them the functionalities they need to solve it. We have to motivate them to take the actions and use functionalities that will help them, <strong>focussing on the why should they use them, not on the how.</strong></p>
          <h4 class="color-subtitle">Empathising with current users</h4>
          <p>We could not forget about our current users, the ones that have been using the product for a long time. We were worried that one they log into the product and see that everything had changed and nothing was where they were used to. They would be confused with the changes in the structure, so they would also have to take an onboarding tour. To analyse how the changes could affect to the current use they do of our product, we created an Affinity Diagram to discover possible friction, pain points and opportunities.</p>

          <p>We created a user journey to better visualise the behaviour and the feelings of these users if one they log into our product and see everything has changed. From it, we could find out some pain points which we should focus to solve through the onboarding to reduce the frustration and help them.</p>

          <h4 class="color-subtitle">Inspiration</h4>
          <p>We explored different ways other applications made the onboarding process to get some inspiration and see if we could incorporate some of them on our onboarding. As a result of this research, I explored different ways in which we could carry out onboarding.<p>
